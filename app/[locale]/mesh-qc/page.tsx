                Grading and testing differ between mesh grit and micron powder, so each has its own
                method. Mesh grit is sized mechanically against a calibrated sieve stack, and the
                buying criteria are the size fraction, the crystal shape, and how the grit breaks
                down under load. Micron powder is a different problem entirely, measured by particle
                counting and controlled on D-values, which{" "}
