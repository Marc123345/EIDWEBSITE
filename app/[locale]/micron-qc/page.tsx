                D50 is the midpoint of the distribution: half the particles sit below it, half above.
                D10 and D90 mark the fine and coarse tails, and span describes how wide the spread is
                between them. Two powders can share a D50 and behave completely differently, because
                the tails are where the surface finish is won or lost.
